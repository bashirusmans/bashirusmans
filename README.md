## 🧑‍🏫 About Me

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and have extensive experience developing scalable backend systems with **Python**, **Django**, and **FastAPI**.

🚀 I led a team of backend engineers at **RapidStart Pty Ltd (Australian Company)** for nearly a year, designing and maintaining robust API services.

💡 My coding journey started during my Bachelor's degree, and I've grown into a proficient **Backend Engineer with a strong Machine Learning background**.

## 🔥 I love working on:

✅ Designing **API-centric backends**, microservice architecture, and scalable platforms  
✅ Implementing **AI-assisted services** — from **Chatbot-like applications (RAG)** to **game playing models with Reinforcement Learning**  
✅ **Web Scraping** with Selenium and BeautifulSoup  
✅ Integrating and optimizing **machine-learning components** into production systems  

---

## 🧪 Some highlights from my portfolio:

🚀 **Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** — designed to answer questions accurately by retrieving knowledge from a custom datastore.  
🚀 **Chess Bot with Reinforcement Learning** — implemented Q-learning to enable a bot to learn strategies by trial and error.  
🚀 **Web Scraping Tools** — automated data collection from numerous sources using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.  
🚀 **Scalable API Backends** — designed and implemented with **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Docker**, serving high-traffic workloads.

## 🌱 Currently, I'm honing my skills in:

✅ **System Design and Architectural Patterns**  
✅ **Scalable, Cloud-native Applications**  
✅ **Deepening my Machine Learning expertise** — particularly in RAG, RL, and service orchestration
